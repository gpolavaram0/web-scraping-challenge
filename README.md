Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

**Used Selenium instead of Splinter, so Chrome webdriver might be needed. I can also demonstrate via Zoom how the web scraper runs

app.py	--- Flask file that runs the HTML and calls scraper
mission_to_mars - Final.ipynb	--- Jupyter Notebookfor the scraper
scrape_mars.py	--- Python file that converts Jupyter notebook to scraper
templates --- Folder that contains the index.html file
